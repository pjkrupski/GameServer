Thoughts on client side prediction:

Sending each keypress to the server and waiting to move the client's player
when a move is validated will lead to an awful experience (you have to wait for
a full round trip before seeing your action).

To combat this, "client side prediction" is often employed. This means that the
client's moves will tentatively be assumed to be good, and rendered for each client.
This causes movements to be instantly seen on the client side (which is good).

Meanwhile, the moves are being sent to the backend for verification. If the server
finds out that you moved into a wall (ie: a malformed or malicious client), your client
is smited by the hand of god (the server) and you lose the game.

Because our map is so simple and static, we can perform 100% accurate client side predictions
on player movements. This means that the only dependency on the server will be the locations of
other players (and the ghost(s)).
